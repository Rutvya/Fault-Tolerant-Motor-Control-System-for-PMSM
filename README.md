This repository contains Simulink model for Fault Tolerant Motor Control for EV and HEV

Steps to run the model
1) Run Parameters.m file
2) Then simulate the model
3) Fault will be inserted at t = 0.7 seconds
4) Output Measurment block inside the Controller subsystem will constain measurment scope for various parameter like speed, position etc.
5) Additional parameters can be monitored from Data Inspector tab
